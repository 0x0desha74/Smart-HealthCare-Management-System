- Entity-specific filters (dates, status, specialization, etc.)



## üìÇ Project Structure

The solution is organized into several projects, each with a specific responsibility:

-   **CareFlow.API**: The main ASP.NET Core Web API project. It contains controllers, DTOs, and handles HTTP requests and responses.
-   **CareFlow.Core**: Contains core business logic, entities, interfaces, and specifications. This project is framework-agnostic.
-   **CareFlow.Repository**: Handles data access logic, including Entity Framework Core contexts and repositories for interacting with the database.
-   **CareFlow.Service**: Implements the business services and orchestrates operations using repositories and core logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the CareFlow API up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   .NET SDK (version compatible with the project, e.g., .NET 6.0 or later)
-   SQL Server (or another compatible database, update connection string accordingly)
-   Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)

### Database Setup

1.  **Update Connection String**: Open `CareFlow.API/appsettings.json` and `CareFlow.API/appsettings.Development.json`. Update the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your SQL Server instance.

    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=CareFlowDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    }
    ```

    Replace `your_server_name` with your SQL Server instance name.

2.  **Apply Migrations**: Navigate to the `CareFlow.Repository` project directory in your terminal and run the following commands to create the database and apply migrations:

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Build the Solution**: Open the solution (`CareFlow.sln`) in Visual Studio or navigate to the root directory in your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

2.  **Run the API**: Navigate to the `CareFlow.API` project directory and run:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    Alternatively, you can run the project directly from Visual Studio/VS Code.

The API will typically be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or a similar port). You can find the exact URL in the console output or in the `launchSettings.json` file within the `CareFlow.API/Properties` directory.

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. **Authentication**: Register a user account or login to get a JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer {token}`
3. **API Calls**: Make requests to the appropriate endpoints based on your role
4. **Error Handling**: Handle standardized error responses

## üìù Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC format
- File uploads support multiple formats with size limitations
- Soft delete is implemented for most entities
- Audit trails are maintained for critical operations
- API follows RESTful conventions with proper HTTP status codes

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based with Claims
- **Validation**: Data Annotations & DTOs
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handling
- **Documentation**: Controller-level API documentation
